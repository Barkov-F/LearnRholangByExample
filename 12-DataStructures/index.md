intro

## Tuples
Tuple can rhyme with either "couple" or "drupal"; both pronunciations are correct. You've seen tuples before when you wrote contracts that take in multiple arguments like `contract c(x, y, z) = { Nil }`. The number of items in a tuple is know as its arity. So the tuple received by contract `c` is three.

Because tuples can take several pieces of data and store them together into one, they are datastructures. They are always a fixed length, and have no methods. Thus they are the least interesting data structure, but at the same time, the most fundamental.

What is the arity of [3, 4, 9, Nil]?
- [ ] 3
- [x] 4
- [ ] 9
- [ ] Nil

What would `("a", "b", "c").get(3)` evaluate to?
#TODO is that even a thing?

### Exercise

## Lists

## Maps
. Maybe make them ourselves? Mention that there will be a nice import system in
