# Going Off Cahin

So far all of our exercises have existed entirely inside the world of rholang. While rholang is meant to be a general-purpose programming language, it's current role is as a blockchain language. Many wonderful smart contracts are being written in rholang . But people don't live their whole lives on-chain. They also go outside and ply, eat dinner, and go to concerts. And while they're away doing those real-world things, they need a place to store their unforgeable names. Because unforgeable names can only exist on the blockchain.

Julie drawing of unforgeable name not allowed to cross some line.

## Cryptography to the Rescue

## Name Registry
A nice feature called the "name registry" will be released in node 0.7 which will make par-ing in from off-chain a much nicer experience. Check back for updates then.
