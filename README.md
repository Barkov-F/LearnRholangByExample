# Learn Rholang By Example

Learn rholang by example and experimentation. The examples and exercises are meant to be run, read, modified and completed. For best results, change anything and everything you are curious about. This tutorial is a tour of the most common and important features of rholang and a fast starting point for motivated learners.


## Target Audience
This tutorial aims to be novice-friendly and introduce rholang from the ground
up. If you've never ever programmed before, you may struggle at times, but
if you know how to write a little python or javascript, you've got all the
background I've assumed.

More background never hurts, and can only help, but I'm not expecting you to
be familiar with process calculi, be a mast of any other languages, or be
able to understand all the theoretical math discussed in the additional
resources.

## Development Environment

### Online Interpreter
The easiest way to get started is to use the [online rholang interpreter](http://rchain.cloud)

### Run locally
Eventually you'll want to run the code locally rather than through a web
interface. That can be done with a docker container or by installing natively.
At the moment, this isn't a very nice process, but will improve. I
plan to eventually write a meta-lesson about getting your development
environment setup.

## Getting started
To begin a lesson, run it and observe its output. See if you can figure out
why it runs the way it does, but if you can't don't worry.

After reading through, and understanding the code, experiment by changing
anything and everything you like. Don't worry about breaking anything; that's
how you learn. You can always restore the original if you don't remember
how to undo your changes.
