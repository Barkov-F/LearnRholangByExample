# Iteration and Recursion

Have students start to copy code an irritating number of times.
A good way to do that is async practice.

Exercise idea
Write a contract that returns a random number between 1 and 3.
Now make it 10
Now make it evens from 1 to 30

That was hard and tedious. There's a better way to do it.


Exercise idea write a countdown program. Solution done.

Exercise: group forwarder. I, the king, send messages to the forwarder who copies them to all the recipients. Rather than just having kill switch, I have the ability to change group subscription.
